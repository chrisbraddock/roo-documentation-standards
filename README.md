# Roo Documentation Standards

This repository contains the official documentation standards for Roo projects. These standards ensure consistency, clarity, and maintainability across all Roo documentation.

## Overview

The documentation standards cover:

- Directory structure for organizing documentation
- Documentation types and their purposes
- Naming conventions for documentation files
- Versioning guidelines for documentation updates

## Getting Started

To apply these standards to your Roo project:

1. Review the [Documentation Standards](./documentation-standards.md)
2. Set up the recommended directory structure in your project
3. Follow the naming conventions for new documentation files
4. Apply the versioning guidelines when updating documentation

## Key Principles

- **Consistency**: Follow the established patterns for all documentation
- **Clarity**: Write documentation that is easy to understand
- **Maintainability**: Structure documentation to be easily updated and extended
- **Discoverability**: Organize documentation so users can find what they need
